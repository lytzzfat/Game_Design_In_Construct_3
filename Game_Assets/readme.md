# Creative Commons Game Assets
Not all art is free, and it takes time to create a work of art. Just as you are working hard on making your games, so-to are artists creating their artwork. You can't just use any Image-Search sourced image in your game, as you don't know if you have permission for using that artwork. That's the focus of today's module, to learn what a Creative Commons asset is, and how you can source these for use in your games.

Below are links to various creative commons game assets. Each asset library will tell you which kind of Creative Commons (CC) license the asset is under. 

## What is the Creative Commons?
Taken from [CreativeCommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-creative-commons-and-what-do-you-do) 
> Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates all over the world who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work.

CC provides a large variety of licenses, and each license tells you what you can and cannot use that product or asset for. You can see all licenses in brief [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). *Please go through this link and read through the license overview carefully* as you will need to provide correct attribution to game assets you have used for your games. You will be assessed on your ability to correctly correct give credit. 

## Royalty-Free Vs. Creative Commons
Creative commons are what it says, they are creative content in the common (public) domain. Royalty free, on the other hand, are *not* in the public domain, but are rather licenses that you can purchase (and sometimes free) where you do not need to pay "royalties" (a small fee) for their use. Generally, royalty free content is available for use in your projects, but only if you first either pay for a subscription, or pay for the content itself. Unsure if you can use content for free? Look on their website for a "usage policy", "license policy", "how to give credit", or "about us" page on the site. For instance, Shutterstock is a "royalty free" site that, has images "you can use them in just about every application possible without paying a royalty fee for each time you use the image". However, look closer on their [licensing page](https://www.shutterstock.com/license-comparison) and you'll see that you must subscribe for $50 a year, and if you unsubscribe, you are no longer allowed to use their images! Always look on websites for either:
- usage policy
- licence policy
- how to give credit
- about us
- FAQ
To discover what your usage rights are. You don't want to use someone else's hard work without giving appropriate credit. 

# CC Resources - Images

Below is a list different game asset resources for you to use. If you find other Creative Commons resources, please send me a message (or raise a Git Issue) to add your resource to this list. 

# [Kenny.nl](https://kenney.nl/) - Artwork & short Sound Effects
A fantastic site with lots of 2D, 3D, isometric, and character sprite assets. Also made here at home in the Netherlands! All content is free, though donations for "asset packs" are of course accepted, though not required. Many assets can be combined using the tile map system object, or taken as individual sprites with the ability for various animation frames to be uploaded.

# [Daniel Cook @ lostgarden](https://lostgarden.home.blog/tag/free-game-graphics/)
A game developer & writer who offers up a lot of content online, in a variety of sources. It will take quite a bit of sourcing on your part, but quite high quality resources. They're all listed as blog posts, and don't include images in their titles, so you'll need to read descriptions.
